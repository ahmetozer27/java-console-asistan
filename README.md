# **Console-Based Assistant Application**

This project represents my early journey into working with APIs and building modular applications using Java. Itâ€™s a console-based assistant that retrieves and processes data from various sources, demonstrating the foundational steps I took in exploring web integration and API usage.

## **About the Project**
- Built during my initial learning phase with Java, focusing on API integration and modular programming.
- Capable of fetching data from different sources like weather updates, exchange rates, and Wikipedia articles.
- Each functionality was developed as a separate module, later combined into a cohesive console application.

## **Features**
- **Wikipedia Integration:** Fetches and processes articles from Wikipedia.  
- **API Exploration:** Retrieves live data, such as weather information and currency exchange rates, showcasing early API usage.  
- **Modular Design:** Separate modules for each feature, combined into a single assistant application.  
- **Console Interface:** A lightweight text-based interface for interacting with the assistant.

## **Why This Project Matters**
This project marks the beginning of my exploration into the world of APIs and modular application development. It highlights my progress in working with external data sources and combining functionalities into a practical, albeit simple, console tool.
